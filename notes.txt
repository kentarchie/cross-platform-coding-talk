set up and installation notes

WSL

sudo apt install gvim
git

But this would be a difficult setup as the WSL doesn't support graphic applications.
This should be done by installing and setting up an X11 server.
A Windows product called X410 is reccomended

then install electron using npm
big choice install local or global
installing local may result in smaller final executable, also allows different
projects to be using different versions
this is the choice GitHub reccomends.
Installing global is a little more convenient, only stores one copy
