Title:
Write Once, Run Several Places:  Cross platform development on the desktop and mobile

Presenter:
Kent Archie

Abstract:
There are several existing technologies that can be used to produce applications
that can be run on multiple desktop OSs (Windows, Mac OS and Linux} and also
systems for building phone apps that will run on both Android and IOS.
I'll talk about a few of these and then I will present examples developed using Electron
for the desktop and Flutter for the mobile world.

Electron is a combination of chromium (for the display) and node.js (for the server).
The appropriate executables for the different OSs get packaged for release by the tool.
The desktop versions of Visual Studio Code, The Atom editor and Slack
are all written using Electron. It is created and supported by Github.

Flutter is a combination of a library of web components for display and executable code written in the Dart
language. 
Flutter and Dart were created and are supported by Google.
Some apps that have been built using Flutter are listed here
